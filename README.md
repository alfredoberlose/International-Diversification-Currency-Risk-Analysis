# International Diversification and Currency Risk Analysis

This project investigates how international diversification and currency fluctuations affect the performance of a global equity portfolio. Starting from the historical data of the JPMorgan Global Equities Fund, a theoretical portfolio is reconstructed using the weighted returns of key regional indices in local currencies.
To simulate the experience of a Euro-based investor, the project incorporates exchange rate movements and compares fund performance with and without currency effects. The analysis highlights how much of the portfolio's return and volatility can be attributed to currency exposure.
The study also explores performance attribution, showing the contributions of asset allocation, stock selection, and currency effects to the overall performance. In addition, efficient frontiers are generated to visually compare risk-return trade-offs in both local and Euro terms.
This work provides a clear and practical insight into the benefits and risks of international investing, especially in terms of currency impact on portfolio outcomes.
